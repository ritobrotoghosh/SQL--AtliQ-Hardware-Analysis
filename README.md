## Situation

Atliq Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and is well-expanded in other countries too. However, the management noticed that they did not get enough insights to make quick and smart, data-informed decisions.

## Task

The management has tasked us with addressing 10 ad-hoc requests.

## Action

The primary goal is to run queries, visualize the results, and present them to top-level management in an easy-to-understand way.

## Results

This will facilitate the management's ability to draw meaningful and data-informed conclusions seamlessly.

## Tools Utilized
